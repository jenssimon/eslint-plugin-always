# eslint-plugin-always

> ESLint plugin that always reports with configurable message

## Why?

It sounds a bit strange to have a ESLint rule that always reports. The reason why this plugin was created is a special use case:

The root ESLint configuration in the project fits for the build scripts but not for the rest of the project.
There is a subfolder that resets the ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "root": true
}
```

So all files in this folder structure won't check any ESLint rules.
The subfolders must contain ESLint configurations which can differ between each subfolder.

For the case that someone adds a subfolder and forgets the ESLint configuration this rule was created. So every file within the subfolder will report an error

> No ESLint configuration present.

## Installation

```sh
$ yarn add eslint-plugin-always --dev
```

## Usage

Add the plugin to your ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "always"
  ]
}
```

And then add the following rule:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "always/always": ["error", {
      "message": "Hello World"
    }]
  }
}
```
